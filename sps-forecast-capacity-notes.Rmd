Seattle Public Schools (SPS) gave a well resourced school update on June 26th 2024 where they recommended investigating a plan for elementary school closures. As part of justification for that plan they pointed at falling enrollment numbers and low capacity percentages for elementary schools. The powerpoint from that June 2024 meeting can be found [here](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/24784284-sps-wrs-update-6_26_24-final-copy-1?responsive=1&title=1). Here are a few notes on those points. 

* Enrollment numbers for 2024-2025 appear not to have dropped as much as was forecasted in that meeting earlier in the year.
* Elementary School capacity numbers would not look nearly as low if using the "right sized capacity" numbers from the school Master Plan document. I am unclear of the context of where the capacity numbers presented in June 2024 came from -- especially given that they appear to have been derived in January 2022 and yet are very different from the numbers published in the September 2021 Master Plan.

# Did enrollment actually drop in 2024-2025 school year?

SPS had contracted Educatonal Data Solutions, LLC to forecast enrollment numbers (notes from that effort found [here](https://www.seattleschools.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Seattle_Enrollment-Demogr-trends_March_2024_ada.pdf)). At the June public meeting SPS displayed this chart of enrollment forecasts:

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("screenshots", "forecasts-data-solutions.png"))
```

If you take the difference in 2023 actual enrollment, you can see for 2024-2025 school year they were projecting a loss of 576 students with a range of 279 to 949 less students in 2024-2025. 

2024-2025 just started, so we can check these forecasts against the September monthly enrollment numbers. If we compare this to the September 2023 vs September 2024 enrollment numbers the actual number of students that dropped was only around 27 if looking at total students or 161 if looking at the September point-in-time count. Kindergarten enrollments actually rose year over year (but this wasn't enough to offset the loss of the comparatively larger graduating class). The Kindergarten class also isn't yet up to the class size of 2022. However it is notable that enrollment numbers (even just one year ahead of forecasts) already exceeded even the most pessimistic figures being communicated by SPS during planning.

The numbers I reference are based on the September monthly enrollment P223 reports that can be found for [sep-2023](https://www.seattleschools.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/P223_Sep23.pdf) and [sep-2024](https://www.seattleschools.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/P223_Sep24.pdf). The forecasts may be of slightly different student count figures (e.g. different times of year or different ways of tabulating counts). However this likely doesn't change the takeaway that enrollment dropped less than expected because for comparisons of *changes* in student enrollment, p223 based year-over-year September enrollment changes have historically offered a decent comparative proxy to what shows-up on official end-of-year numbers (especially as a comparative measure about year over year change). For example the drop from [September 2022](https://www.seattleschools.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/P223_Sep22.pdf) to September 2023 was much much larger than this year's drop. 

It's also worth noting also that SPS contracted another firm, Flo Analytics, as a second firm to do forecasting ([report](https://www.seattleschools.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Seattle-PS-2024-25-to-2033-34-enrollment-forecast-document.pdf)). They forecasted a drop of 552 students with a range of 27 to 976 students. The actual drop may fall within the range of Flo Analytics' forecasts. (However these forecasts were not shared in public meetings or presentationsduring the time when SPS was announcing their initial school closure plans.)

# The formula for "% Capacity" seems to have changed between years

One other expalanation for the need to close schools was the seemingly low capacity rates of elementary schools. The capacity rates by school are included in the Appendix of the June 2024 presentation. A copy of these tables can be found from a "Sazan Envrionmental Services Facility Assessment Report" conducted in January 2022 [here](https://www.seattleschools.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/sazan-scores-capacity.pdf) however this table doesn't put these numbers in context. Other reports by Sazan seem more concerned on Building Condition, Learning Environment, and Accessibility Evaluation (see SPS' website [here](https://www.seattleschools.org/departments/capital-projects-and-planning/facilities-master-plan/#gd71995336887)). Strangely, these January 2022 capacity numbers are very different from SPS' September 2021 Facilities Master Plan document which appears like a more authoritative source on the subject (given it is an actual report and not just isolated tables).

Skimming elementary school the number of students for a school to be at "capacity" looks to be about ~25% higher on the Appendix of the June 2024 presentation compared to what can be found on page 42 of the September 2021 Master Plan document. What's the effect? Depending on how many students are deemed appropriate for a school determines the percent capacity of schools. Using higher "right capacity" numbers represents schools as being more empty.

**NOTE THAT THESE ARE JUST A FEW INITIAL NOTES THAT NEED TO BE INVESTIGATED MORE CAREFULLY**
